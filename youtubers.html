<p class="center">
    Joseph Anderson: Hands down the most in depth, honest and respectable "journalist" out there (imo). goes in depth to all <br> aspects of video games and covers multiple points of views such as a mechanic from a developers point of view and also from a players point <br> of view. It helps to show the transfer of information from developer to player and how despite some things desired intentions they <br> may come across differently. Because of the depth the video lengths range from 30 minutes to 2 hours on average.
